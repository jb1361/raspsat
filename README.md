# raspsat
Raspberry pi cubesat software. Original software used Aurduinos which quickly ran out of space for the software.
## Requirements

- PyCharm Professional - This project uses PyCharm Professional for the remote interpreter along with deployment to both pi's. You can use other tools if you wish but you will have to set them up yourself. 
- Two raspberry pi's model 3 and up.

## Setup

* Enable ssh on both pi's and both are able to be connected to via ssh. Hook up ethernet cable, connect to wifi, etc.
* Go to `File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Deployment`
